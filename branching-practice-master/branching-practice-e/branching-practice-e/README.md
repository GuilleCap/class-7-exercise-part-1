# Branching and Merging

## Introduction
This repository contains the starter files for the 'Branching and Merging' exercise.

As part of this exercise you will:

- Review the contents of a conversation that has been distributed across multiple branches.
- Reassemble the conversation by merging the branch contents back into `master`.
- Address merge conflicts and commit the result.

Please review the accompanying class materials for additional details.

## Instructions and Suggested Approach
The `master` branch of this repository contains a file named `CONVERSATION.md`, which is currently empty. The contents of the file have been spread across 6 branches, each of which contains a single commit that is _not_ present on any other branch. Your job is to reassemble the conversation _on_ the `master`. In order to do this you must:

- Fork this repository to your own account.
- Review the other branches and their contents.
- Identify the conversation order.
- Merge the contents of each branch back into the `master` branch.
- Address any merge conflicts that arise.

When you're done you should have a `CONVERSATION.md` file that contains the full 6 part conversation in the correct order. Your master branch should also contain the commits from the other branches (note: this will happen naturally as a result of the merge process). You must _not_ modify the existing commits.

Make sure to review the contents of `CONVERSATION.md` and the Git history before submitting the exercise.

## Hints
- Make sure to review the contents of each branch before starting to merge.
- The portions of the conversation are numbered.
